title: Image Quality Analysis Test
description: Verify that the AI-guided ultrasound software produces high-quality images and that the images are accurately displayed.
steps:
  - step: Activate the ultrasound system and select the AI-guided imaging mode
    acceptance_criteria: AI-guided imaging mode is selected successfully without any errors
  - step: Prepare the test subject according to the system's instructions
    acceptance_criteria: Test subject is correctly prepared and ready for scanning
  - step: Perform a scan of the subject with AI-guided assistance enabled
    acceptance_criteria: Scan is completed successfully with AI assistance active throughout
  - step: Observe and record the clarity and resolution of the captured image
    acceptance_criteria: Captured image is clear, high-resolution, and accurately represents the anatomy without significant artifacts or distortions
  - step: Display the captured image on the system screen or external display
    acceptance_criteria: Image is displayed accurately without distortion, maintaining correct scaling and aspect ratios
  - step: Utilize the image manipulation tools (e.g., zoom, pan, rotate, crop) on the captured image
    acceptance_criteria: Image manipulation tools function correctly; image quality is maintained during manipulation without introducing artifacts or distortions
  - step: Export the captured image to DICOM format
    acceptance_criteria: Images are successfully exported in the correct format while preserving all image quality and metadata
  - step: Compare the exported DICOM image with the original displayed image
    acceptance_criteria: Exported DICOM image maintains the same quality, resolution, and diagnostic value as the original displayed image, and all image parameters (including pixel values, window/level settings, and spatial resolution) are preserved without any loss or degradation during the export process
