title: Image Quality Analysis Testing
description: Validate the AI-guided ultrasound system's image quality, focusing on clarity, contrast, and resolution during both acquisition and display. Ensure images are free from distortion and artifacts, and verify that image quality is maintained through post-processing and export operations. The test evaluates both real-time image acquisition and post-processing capabilities.
steps:
  - step: Initialize the test environment and create a new ImageTest instance
    acceptance_criteria: ImageTest instance is created successfully and ready for testing operations, with all required dependencies loaded and test environment properly configured
  - step: Prepare the test subject according to the system's instructions
    acceptance_criteria: Test subject is correctly prepared and ready for scanning
  - step: Perform a scan of the subject with AI-guided assistance enabled
    acceptance_criteria: Scan is completed successfully with AI assistance active throughout
  - step: Observe and record the image quality metrics including clarity, resolution, contrast ratio, and signal-to-noise ratio of the captured image
    acceptance_criteria: Captured image is clear, high-resolution, and accurately represents the anatomy without significant artifacts or distortions
  - step: Display the captured image on the system screen or external display
    acceptance_criteria: Image is displayed accurately without distortion, maintaining correct scaling and aspect ratios
  - step: Utilize the image manipulation tools (e.g., zoom, pan, rotate, crop) on the captured image
    acceptance_criteria: Image manipulation tools function correctly; image quality is maintained during manipulation without introducing artifacts or distortions
  - step: Export the captured image to DICOM format
    acceptance_criteria: Images are successfully exported in the correct format while preserving all image quality and metadata
  - step: Compare the exported DICOM image with the original displayed image
    acceptance_criteria: Exported DICOM image maintains the same quality, resolution, and diagnostic value as the original displayed image, and all image parameters (including pixel values, window/level settings, and spatial resolution) are preserved without any loss or degradation during the export process
  - step: Document and archive test results including image quality metrics, system performance data, and any observations
    acceptance_criteria: All test results, metrics, and observations are properly documented and archived according to established protocols, including quantitative measurements of image quality parameters, system response times, and any deviations or anomalies noted during testing
