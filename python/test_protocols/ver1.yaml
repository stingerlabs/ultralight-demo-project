title: Image Quality Analysis Testing
description: Verify that the AI-guided ultrasound software produces high-quality images with optimal clarity, resolution, and contrast, and that these images are accurately displayed and preserved throughout the imaging workflow including capture, display, manipulation, and export processes.
steps:
  - step: Power on the ultrasound system and navigate to the AI-guided imaging mode in the system menu
    acceptance_criteria: System powers on successfully with all indicator lights functioning normally, boots to a responsive state within the expected timeframe of 60 seconds, displays the startup screen without errors or artifacts, and successfully navigates to the main menu showing all expected UI elements and imaging mode options clearly visible and selectable
  - step: Prepare the test subject according to the system's instructions
    acceptance_criteria: Test subject is correctly prepared and ready for scanning
  - step: Perform a scan of the subject with AI-guided assistance enabled
    acceptance_criteria: Scan is completed successfully with AI assistance active throughout
  - step: Observe and record the image quality metrics including clarity, resolution, contrast ratio, and signal-to-noise ratio of the captured image
    acceptance_criteria: Captured image is clear, high-resolution, and accurately represents the anatomy without significant artifacts or distortions
  - step: Display the captured image on the system screen or external display
    acceptance_criteria: Image is displayed accurately without distortion, maintaining correct scaling and aspect ratios
  - step: Utilize the image manipulation tools (e.g., zoom, pan, rotate, crop) on the captured image
    acceptance_criteria: Image manipulation tools function correctly; image quality is maintained during manipulation without introducing artifacts or distortions
  - step: Export the captured image to DICOM format
    acceptance_criteria: Images are successfully exported in the correct format while preserving all image quality and metadata
  - step: Compare the exported DICOM image with the original displayed image
    acceptance_criteria: Exported DICOM image maintains the same quality, resolution, and diagnostic value as the original displayed image, and all image parameters (including pixel values, window/level settings, and spatial resolution) are preserved without any loss or degradation during the export process
  - step: Document and archive test results including image quality metrics, system performance data, and any observations
    acceptance_criteria: All test results, metrics, and observations are properly documented and archived according to established protocols, including quantitative measurements of image quality parameters, system response times, and any deviations or anomalies noted during testing
